QUESTION-1: In the first question we have talked about the Hierarchical Clustering in that we have find out the clustering representations and also we have talked about the single,complete and average link proximity in that clustering technique

QUESTION-2: In this we have processed the data we have in the GENERAL.csv file and we got all the data present in the data file and we used standard scalar to normalize the functions and then we used PCA with k=2 and reduced the input dimensions and we have used Agglomerative Clustering with values 2,3,4,5 and we have finally differentiated the variations using the silhoutte score with a bar graph.
